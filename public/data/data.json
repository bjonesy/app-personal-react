            "Using PHP, JavaScript, and Gulp, I built and managed the technical migration of the Rare Country brand vertical to its own unique website, RareCountry.com. Originally a segment of Rare.us, Rare Country’s popularity and success warranted the creation of its own dedicated site.  In addition to building the new site, I also supported the content migration efforts.  During this migration, I successfully accommodated late-stage requirement changes from the primary ad sponsor, including a full-page ad and two banner ads across the new site homepage and article page.  I was able to set these ads up quickly using JavaScript, PHP and CSS to help meet the short deadline. (June 2017)",
            "Learned Python, with no prior experience, to help build out a data dashboard of Google analytics data for sessions and page view per sessions.  This involved tapping into 5 different brand websites to access the Google analytics data from the Google Analytics API, storing this data into multiple Mongo databases and then using Jinja 2 to display the data in a dashboard format. (December 2016)",
            "Worked overtime with the design team to help implement brand design architecture and led development for the first all-digital awards experience to honor 2016’s best-in-country music.  Using JavaScript and browser cookies, I created a voting polling system that was used to track votes for multiple musicians in multiple categories over a four-week period. To accommodate a smooth voting experience, a series of JavaScript modals would allow users to seamlessly vote multiple times and share each vote to a variety of different social channels without a page load.  These results were tallied together to award country music artists, such as Blake Shelton, their perspective awards per category. (2016)",
            "Took over the development from a 3rd party vendor and was the sole developer for 2+ years.  Once the site achieved major success, additional developers and supporting team was built up",

            "Helped gather data and analytics from Google analytics A/B testing",
